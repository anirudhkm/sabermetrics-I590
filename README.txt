3. We ran the R programs on Rstudio, which can be downloded from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. 

Notes:

1. Initially, we tried to implement the analyses with Hadoop, we couldn't do faced issues with that. 
2. So we consulted professor Fox during the discussion sessions, he said to carry the analyses with R alone.
